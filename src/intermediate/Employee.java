/*
 * STEP 1
 * Create a class called Employee. Add globally accessible
 * properties: name,dob,gender,basic_salary,benefits,gross_salary.
 * Add method to calculate gross_salary i.e  basic_salary + benefits.
 * NB: Use a constructor to instantiate the properties
 * 
 * STEP 2
 * Create a class called EmployeeRunner. It should contain the 
 * main method.Create an object of Employee and pass args
 * for the constructor
 * 
 * STEP 3
 * Change the global variables to private. What happens?
 * We can no longer access the class properties using an 
 * object. Changing the properties to private is meant to 
 * prevent them to be changed by the object,instead we use 
 * methods change and access them. These methods are called
 * getters(used to get the values) and setters(used to set
 * the values). This is called ENCAPSULATION i.e preventing
 * variables from direct outside acess instead we use methods
 * to access them.
